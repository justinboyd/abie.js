A Better Internet Experience:

abie.js is a tiny plugin that allows you to easily reward your users for having an up-to-date/compatible browser.

You can designate the kinds of merits and demerits your users should experience. You are free to reward
your users with points, additional content, funny videos, avatars, a simple thank you or anything else you
feel your users deserve.
